- [Apollo Docs Queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/queries/)
- [Next.js with-apollo example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-apollo). The code in `lib/apolloClient.js` could be helpful

- [Apollo Client Server Side Rendering](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/performance/server-side-rendering/)
- [next-apollo](https://github.com/adamsoffer/next-apollo) - This one seems to get it right.
